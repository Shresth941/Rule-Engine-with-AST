Rule Engine with AST
This project implements a rule-based engine using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for dynamic rule creation, evaluation, and modification. It features a frontend built with React, a backend powered by Node.js and Express, and utilizes MongoDB Atlas for data storage.

Features
Rule Creation: Define custom rules that are converted into AST.
Rule Combination: Merge multiple rules for complex evaluations.
Evaluation: Check data against the defined rules using the AST.
Tree Visualization: View rules in a structured tree format.
